# danki - Command line application for creating anki flashcards.

Danki is a command line application for creating anki flashcards from a dhall config.

This is in early stages and not very sophisticated, but you can try it out using the [sample decks](https://gitlab.com/homotopic-tech/danki-sample-decks) to get working output.

# Install

```
stack install danki
```

# Run

cd to the sample decks repository and run

```
danki
```
