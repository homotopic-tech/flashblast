# flashblast

Flashblast is a command line application for creating anki flashcards from a dhall config.

This is in early stages and has some rough edges, but you can try it out using
the [sample decks](https://gitlab.com/homotopic-tech/flashblast-sample-decks) to get
working output.

## Install

```
stack install flashblast
```

## Run

cd to the sample decks repository and run

```
flashblast
```
